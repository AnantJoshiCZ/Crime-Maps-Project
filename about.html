        <h4>The Crime Maps Project is an opensource project aimed at creating a hub where users can find interesting and informative crime maps. This project is the brainchild of Anant Joshi who has created it as part of his Final Year Thesis. The base of this project lies in Data Analysis and Data Science. The original world maps have been created using R programming language and GoogleVis visualization package.
          The data for this project has been sourced from The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). This data is publically available at their site: </h4><a href="http://www.unodc.org/">http://www.unodc.org/</a><h4>. <br> The data for several different kinds of crimes is available and has been used to create interactive world maps. <u> The maps currently show total numbers of instances of crime and the per capita rate of crimes. The color of the maps is relative to per capita crimes. Brighter colors mean lower per capita rate of crime while darker colors mean high per capita rate of crime. The light grey regions represent countries which did not have any data available.</u> <br> <br> Note: The data has been compiled by respective government agencies and the legal definition of a particular crime may vary in different countries. Also, the data for United Kingdom is currently inaccurate and shows only data for England.
